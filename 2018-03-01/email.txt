Hi Klaas,

I have appended the results into your spreadsheets - see attached. 

QSPEC
- see columns "S"-"W" in your spreadsheet
- used same parameters as before: 5000 burn-in, 20000 iterations
- found 11 proteins with fdr < 0.05

GLEE
- see columns "Y"-"Z" in your spreadsheet
- used 10000 iterations, cubic interpolation
- found 30 proteins with pVal < 0.01

There is an overlap of 9 proteins between QSPEC and GLEE, in terms of significant diff-exp proteins. 

T-test
- see columns "P"-"T" in your spreadsheet
- did two-sided t-test (wt vs cgep) using 3 replicates each, assuming unequal variance

Let me know if you need any further analysis. 

Thanks,
Lalit
