Hi Klaas,

Using your complete dataset, there's two ways to test for significant differences between genotypes:

Approach 1: Using two-way ANOVA

This approach treats the genotype and function as "factors", and fits the following model:

level = mean + genotype + function + error

As shown in the first sheet of the attached "two-way-anova.xlsx", both function and genotype have a significant effect. 

To find out which pairs of genotypes are significantly different, we run multiple pairwise comparisons using the "Tukey HSD" method. Results in the second sheet of "two-way-anova.xlsx" indicate that
* prep & opda are significantly different, at 95% confidence (since adj.p.value < 0.05)
* if you drop the confidence to 90%, then WT & prep also turn out to be significantly different

This approach seems best-suited to address your question, since ANOVA is a well-established technique that allows you test for genotype-differences while accounting for other sources of variation. 

For information on 2-way anova, and how to use it to test for differences, visit the following links:

- http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/two-way-anova-test-in-r#compute-two-way-anova-test

Approach 2: Using pairwise t-tests for each function

In this approach, we select pairs of genotypes, and we check for differences function-wise. This way, we end up doing a lot of t-tests, as shown in the attached "func-tests.xlsx". 
This approach has a few drawbacks:
* it takes a fine-grained view at the individual function-level, and does not quantify overall difference between genotypes
* it requires correction of p-values, due to multiple-testing (e.g. via the Bonferroni procedure)

I would recommend going with "Approach 1" for genotype difference across all functions. But if you want to illustrate a few function-specific differences, you can use some of the output from "Approach 2" as well. 

Let me know if you have questions or need further analysis.

// 1: pairwise genotypic difference in each function //
for each function (i.e. organelle-function combination), you can do t-tests to check for differences in every pair of genotypes : see func-tests.xlsx
- the first sheet does not assume equal-variance, while the last sheet does
- as per sheet2, equal-variance is not a bad assumption to make, but we'll stay away from it (to avoid having to explain why we made that assumption), so use sheet1 results


// 2: pairwise genotypic difference across functions //
use 1-way ANOVA in each gen1-gen2 pair
  http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/wiki.php?title=one-way-anova-test-in-r#compute-one-way-anova-test
use 2-way ANOVA with all the data, testing for effect of genotype, function, and their interaction

// misc thoughts //
- do a paired t-test since the same function's replicates are being used ?
- make the t-test non-parametric, e.g. Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney ?: https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/spss/whatstat/what-statistical-analysis-should-i-usestatistical-analyses-using-spss/
